#summary Simple Bean Conversion

= Client and Service Bean = 
Let's take below client bean.
{{{
public class ClientBean{
   private int id;
   private String name;
}
}}}

Service Bean looks like
{{{
public class ServiceBean{
  private int id;
  private String name;
}
}}}

= Create Bean Converter =
  Now, we are going to create bean converter which converts service bean to client bean. We can create using new operator as 
{{{
 BeanConverter converter = new AnnotationBeanConverter();
}}}

 If you are using spring,We can inject via spring xml like
{{{
 <bean id="converter" class="com.xbean.converter.impl.AnnotationBeanConverter"/>
}}}

 Now, using this converter, we are going to convert a service bean to client bean without using any getters or setters as follows.
{{{
 ClientBean clientBean = converter.convert(ClientBean.class,serviceBean);
}}}
 Here,serviceBean parameter is instance of ServiceBean class.The above method returns clientBean object which contains respective values from serviceBean object.
